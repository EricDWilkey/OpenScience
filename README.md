### What is this project about and what does it do?
Well, this project is my foray into getting all of my R code into a version, controlled github directory and pushing myself into the dawn of a new, efficient workflow.

### Why should people care, and why is it useful?
There is absolutely no reason why other people should care, other than that I may be a better scientist and happier person as my skill advance. OK, well maybe people should care in a sort of personal, celebratory way.

### How can someone get started contributing to the project?
This is a journey I must take alone. Soon, I will be collaborating with the best of them.

### Who can be contacted in case someone needs help.
I'm not sure what you would be doing to need help...
